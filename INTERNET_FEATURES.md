# Internet Checking and Web Loading Features

This project has been enhanced with robust internet connectivity checking and web loading features based on the reference implementation in the `referencedata` folder.

## New Features Added

### üåê Internet Connectivity Monitoring

- **Real-time connectivity detection** using `connectivity_plus` package
- **Automatic reconnection** when internet is restored
- **Network quality checking** with actual DNS lookup verification
- **WiFi vs Mobile data detection**
- **Graceful offline state handling**

### üì± Enhanced WebView Implementation

- **Switched to `flutter_inappwebview`** for better performance and features
- **Progress indicators** with percentage display during loading
- **Last visited URL persistence** using SharedPreferences
- **Automatic page reload** when connectivity is restored
- **Better error handling** for network issues

### üîÑ Loading States

- **Smart loading screens** that adapt to connectivity status
- **Progress tracking** with visual indicators
- **Smooth transitions** between loading and content states
- **User-friendly error messages** with retry options

## Dependencies Added

```yaml
dependencies:
  flutter_inappwebview: ^6.0.0
  shared_preferences: ^2.2.2
  connectivity_plus: ^6.0.5
```

## Key Implementation Details

### Internet Checking Flow

1. **Initial Check**: App checks connectivity on startup
2. **Continuous Monitoring**: Listens for connectivity changes
3. **DNS Verification**: Performs actual network test by pinging Google DNS
4. **State Management**: Updates UI based on connectivity status
5. **Auto-Recovery**: Automatically reloads content when connection restored

### WebView Enhancements

- **InAppWebView Integration**: More powerful than standard WebView
- **Better Performance**: Hybrid composition for Android
- **Enhanced Security**: SSL handling and mixed content support
- **Memory Management**: Proper disposal and resource cleanup

### User Experience Features

- **Offline Screen**: Shows friendly message when no internet
- **Retry Mechanism**: Easy retry button for failed connections
- **Progress Feedback**: Visual progress indicators during loading
- **Back Button Handling**: Smart navigation with exit confirmation
- **URL Persistence**: Remembers last visited page

## Configuration Support

The internet checking features work seamlessly with the existing configuration system:

```json
{
  "offlineMessage": "Please check your internet connection",
  "loadingMessage": "Loading your content...",
  "errorMessage": "Unable to load content"
}
```

## Testing Internet Features

1. **Run the app** with internet connection
2. **Disable WiFi/Mobile data** to see offline screen
3. **Re-enable connection** to see automatic reload
4. **Test various network conditions** (slow, intermittent)

## Network Utility Class

A `NetworkUtils` class provides convenient methods:

- `hasInternetConnection()` - Check current connectivity
- `connectivityStream` - Listen to connectivity changes
- `isConnectedToWiFi()` - Check WiFi status
- `isConnectedToMobile()` - Check mobile data status

## Error Handling

The implementation handles various network scenarios:

- DNS resolution failures
- SSL certificate issues
- Server timeouts
- Slow network conditions
- Connection drops during loading

## Demo Script

Run the demo script to see connectivity features:

```bash
dart run scripts/demo_dynamic_config.dart
```

This shows:

- Configuration loading examples
- Internet checking capabilities
- Error handling scenarios
- Feature demonstrations

## Reference Implementation

The implementation is based on the working code in the `referencedata` folder, which demonstrates:

- Production-ready connectivity handling
- Proper WebView lifecycle management
- User-friendly loading states
- Robust error recovery

All features maintain backward compatibility with existing configuration files while adding powerful new connectivity capabilities.
