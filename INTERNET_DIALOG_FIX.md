# Internet Connection Dialog Fix

## Problem

The "no internet connection" popup was appearing after the webview page loaded successfully, even when the internet connection was working fine.

## Root Cause

The issue was in the `onReceivedError` callback in the InAppWebView, which was showing the internet dialog for **any** webview error, not just network-related errors.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Smart Error Detection

- Added `_isNetworkError()` method to filter only network-related errors
- Checks error descriptions for network-related keywords like "network", "connection", "timeout", "host", "dns", etc.
- Only shows internet dialog for actual connectivity issues

### 2. Loading State Awareness

- Modified `_showNoInternetDialog()` to prevent showing dialog when webview has loaded successfully
- Added check: `if (isWebViewReady && !isLoading) return;`
- Only shows dialog during initial loading or when page is actively loading

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

- Updated `onReceivedError` to only trigger dialog for network errors during loading
- Added condition: `if (_isNetworkError(error) && isLoading)`
- Verifies actual connectivity status before showing dialog

### 4. Improved Connectivity Listener

- Enhanced connectivity listener to avoid unnecessary reloads
- Only reloads when connection is restored and webview is not currently loading
- Added condition: `if (connected && webViewController != null && !isLoading)`

## Code Changes

### Added Network Error Detection

```dart
bool _isNetworkError(WebResourceError error) {
  final networkKeywords = [
    'network', 'connection', 'timeout', 'host', 'dns',
    'internet', 'offline', 'unreachable', 'failed to connect',
    'no internet', 'connection refused', 'server not found'
  ];

  final description = error.description.toLowerCase();
  return networkKeywords.any((keyword) => description.contains(keyword));
}
```

### Enhanced Dialog Prevention

```dart
void _showNoInternetDialog() {
  // Don't show dialog if webview has loaded successfully
  if (isWebViewReady && !isLoading) {
    return;
  }
  // ... rest of dialog code
}
```

### Smarter Error Handling

```dart
onReceivedError: (controller, request, error) {
  print("WebView Error: ${error.description}");
  if (mounted) {
    // Only show internet dialog for network-related errors
    // and only if the page hasn't loaded successfully yet
    if (_isNetworkError(error) && isLoading) {
      _checkConnectivity();
      if (!hasInternet) {
        _showNoInternetDialog();
      }
    }
  }
},
```

## Result

- ✅ No more false "no internet connection" popups after successful page loads
- ✅ Dialog only appears for actual network connectivity issues
- ✅ Better user experience with smart error detection
- ✅ Maintains all connectivity monitoring features
- ✅ Preserves automatic retry functionality

## Testing

1. Load a webpage successfully - no popup should appear
2. Disconnect internet during loading - popup should appear appropriately
3. Reconnect internet - automatic reload should work
4. Test with various network conditions - only real connectivity issues trigger dialog
